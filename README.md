Unscene - CS 321 Group 4
This Java project was developed with Apache Netbeans. It is a semester team project that allows users to create Movie and TV Show watchlists and keep track of their progress. The user can add media from the "Discover" page to their watchlists as well. All media data, including titles, descriptions, and thumbnails, are pulled from TheMovieDB API.
